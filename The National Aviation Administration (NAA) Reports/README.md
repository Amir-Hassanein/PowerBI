## The Problem: Commercial Flight Delays

The National Aviation Administration (NAA) of the United States is the entity that monitors the airports' operations around the country. During the last few years, the State of New York has presented significant delays in the departure of its flights, and it is beginning to impact the operations of other airports in the country. Most airports claim it is related to some airlines' inefficiencies when boarding passengers, while the airlines link the delays to the lack of sufficient runways. The NAA's main concern is that without an efficient operation, there will be an overall decline in passengers using this means of travel, the government will reduce the investment in the aviation industry, and the NAA will be fined for not completing its tasks.

## Your Tasks

The NAA has hired you as an analytics consultant to review the recent performance of the State of New York commercial flights. You should understand and summarize the current conditions and include recommendations to improve passengers' satisfaction when departing from New York airports. It is also crucial for the NAA to identify when departure delays occur to define additional policies to improve flight operations.

Finally, there will be a significant event in Florida on the 6th of January, 2022. The NAA expects many people to travel from New York City that week. We have created a Machine Learning model that predicts the probability of delay of those flights. Your task is to explain what should be the decision that minimizes the risk of taking a delayed flight and recommend the flights with the lowest probability of being delayed.

## The Data

You will be provided with data for all commercial flights that departed from the State of New York in 2021, including the departure hour and passenger satisfaction score, among other relevant information. Also, you have access to the main features of the airports and airlines that currently operate in the State.

## Power BI Report

The NAA wants a report using Power BI with all the relevant visualization and a final page of conclusions with your findings and recommendations. Draw conclusions from your analysis and use visuals to answer the following questions.

## Project Overview

### Analysis Questions

* A1. What were the average take-off delay and average passenger satisfaction score for all flights in the State of New York in 2021?

* A2. Explain what variable influences the passenger satisfaction score the most.

* A3. Choose a season and explain what should be the average value of the variable from A2 to achieve a minimum passenger satisfaction score of 6.1.

* A4. The NAA plans to open four offices in the State of New York to perform weekly on-site operational supervision in the airports.
* The NAA wants each office to be in charge of at most five airports. There are two options, open the offices using a location-based strategy (location closer to the airports) or a volume-based strategy (location based on the yearly passengers of the airports). Which approach would be better if each office could supervise at most five airports?

* A5. Explain the pattern of delayed flights during the last year and the forecasted delays for the next month.
* A6. Also, the NAA needs to understand the dates with very high or very low delays to investigate further what happened.

* A7. With the prediction model that the NAA is using, what is influencing the predicted probability of delay? Which three flights would you recommend for a passenger booking a flight?
