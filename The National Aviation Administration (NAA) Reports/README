The National Aviation Administration (NAA) of the United States is the entity that monitors the airports' operations around the country. During the last few years, the State of New York has presented significant delays in the departure of its flights, and it is beginning to impact the operations of other airports in the country. Most airports claim it is related to some airlines' inefficiencies when boarding passengers, while the airlines link the delays to the lack of sufficient runways. The NAA's main concern is that without an efficient operation, there will be an overall decline in passengers using this means of travel, the government will reduce the investment in the aviation industry, and the NAA will be fined for not completing its tasks.
